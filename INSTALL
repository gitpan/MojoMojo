INSTALLING MOJOMOJO
-------------------

http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/wiki/MojoMojo


1. Download the source (which you're probably already done, given you're
reading this file!)

2. Run the following command while in the directory containing the MojoMojo
files:
    perl Makefile.PL
(Module::AutoInstall should already be installed for this to work.)
NB. This requirement will go away once we make a dist of MojoMojo.

This will check your system to make sure that all the appropriate dependencies
are installed, if they aren't then make files will be created to install them,
if this is the case then you should run the following command as root:
    make
and follow the on-screen instructions. This may take some time as dependencies
may have further dependancies which also need to be downloaded.

a) 
(i)  Make sure your config file has a valid dsn for your database (You can use SQLite, mysql or Pg - sqlite by default)
(ii) Import the table structure, by running the following script:
    ./script/mojomojo_spawn_db.pl


4. Tests be can run using the following command:
    CATALYST_DEBUG=0 TEST_POD=0 prove --lib lib/ t/

Changing the first 0 to a 1 will result in extra debugging information from
the Catalyst engine.


5.
a) Catalyst includes a test server which can be started using:
    ./scripts/mojomojo_server -p 3000
where 3000 is the port number and the default if no port is specified.

or

b) Set up Apache using either mod_perl or FastCGI.

See
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst/lib/Catalyst/Manual/Cookbook.pod#Using_FastCGI
for further information.

6. mojomojo.yml is the main configuration file and is in YAML format.

Unless using SQLite as your database, you will need to set appropriate fields
under
Model::DBIC:
    connect_info:

For instance, for MySQL:
        - dbi:mysql:database=mojo_database;host=localhost, mojo_user, password
or for SQLite:
        - dbi:SQLite:__HOME__/db/sqlite/mojomojo.db

If your server is connected to a http proxy you may need to add the following
line:
using_frontend_proxy: 1

Note that you should use spaces for indenting when using YAML, rather than
tabs.
