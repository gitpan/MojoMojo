INSTALLING MOJOMOJO
  Step 1 (install)
    Install MojoMojo either using the cpan shell like this:

        cpan MojoMojo

    or by downloading the tarball from http://search.cpan.org/dist/MojoMojo
    and running perl Makefile.PL on it manually. This is the most common
    method.  If you do this, run

        make installdeps 
        
    to get all the required modules installed.

  Step 2 (configure)
    mojomojo.conf is the main configuration file and is in Config::General
    format.

    First make sure your config file has a valid dsn for your database (You
    can use SQLite, mysql or Pg - sqlite by default). The setting you change
    is connect_info in the Model::DBIC Block.

    For instance, for MySQL: -
    dbi:mysql:database=mojo_database;host=localhost, mojo_user, password or
    for SQLite: - dbi:SQLite:__HOME__/db/sqlite/mojomojo.db

    Once the db is setup, import the table structure, by running the
    following script:

        ./script/mojomojo_spawn_db.pl

    This script has sane defaults for a test install, but you can
    override these. Run it with --help to see usage information.

  Step 3 (start)
    Do one of these:

    Catalyst includes a test server which can be started using:
            ./script/mojomojo_server -p 3000

        where 3000 is the port number and the default if no port is
        specified. Note that if you install it through the cpan shell,
        mojomojo_server will be found in your bin directory. or
        alternatively:

    Set up Apache using either mod_perl or FastCGI.
        See
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst/lib/Catalyst/Manual/Cookbook.po
        d#Using_FastCGI for further information on FastCGI, or you can look
        at Catalyst::Engine::Apache for info on setting up Catalyst apps in
        Apache.

    If your server is connected to a http proxy you may need to add the
    following line to the main config block:

        using_frontend_proxy 1

  Step 4 (login)
        Login to your MojoMojo and change the admin password: 
        login/pass is admin/admin.
        
  Step 5 (create)
        Create a new page.  Decide what URL you would like for the page then 
        browse to that URL.  You will then be asked to add content.  For example,
        suppose I want a page about Indiana University basketball.  I might 
        choose to create it at /Basketball/University/Indiana
